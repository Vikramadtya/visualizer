# About Me

Hello <span className="wavy">ðŸ‘‹</span> I'm `Vikramaditya Singh`, a technology enthusiast with a deep love for programming. Currently, employeed as a Software Engineer II at Cisco. My expertise spans Algorithms, Data Structures, and Application Development, complemented by a strong foundation in Linux, Networking, and Databases.

Recently, I've discovered a passion for tech blogging and writing. I'm enthusiastic about sharing insights and knowledge from the ever-evolving world of technology, making complex topics accessible and engaging for all.

Currently I'm Learning `NextJS` to build modern web applications and also exploring `Data Science` and `Machine Learning`.

## Tech Stack I'm familiar with

```java
// Optimized java implementation of Bubble sort
import java.io.*;

class GFG {

    // An optimized version of Bubble Sort
    static void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n){
        int i, j, temp;
        boolean swapped;
        for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            swapped = false;
            for (j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {

                    // Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
                    temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                    swapped = true;
                }
            }

            // If no two elements were
            // swapped by inner loop, then break
            if (swapped == false)
                break;
        }
    }

    // Function to print an array
    static void printArray(int arr[], int size){
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        System.out.println();
    }

    // Driver program
    public static void main(String args[]){
        int arr[] = { 64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90 };
        int n = arr.length;
        bubbleSort(arr, n);
        System.out.println("Sorted array: ");
        printArray(arr, n);
    }
}
