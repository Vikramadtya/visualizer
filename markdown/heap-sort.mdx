Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that leverages the Binary Heap data structure. It can be viewed as an optimized version of selection sort. Instead of linearly finding the maximum (or minimum) element, it uses a Binary Heap to efficiently identify and move the max (or min) element in $$\text{O}(n\log{n})$$ time. This element is then swapped with the last (or first) in the list. The process is repeated for the remaining elements, resulting in an overall time complexity of $$\text{O}(n\log{n})$$.

The sorting works as follows

- With input data, create a max heap
- The root element is the max element
- delete the root node of the max-heap and replace it with the last node and heapify
- repeat till no elements in the heap

## Heap

Visualize the array as a complete binary tree. For an array of size $$n$$, the root is at index $$0$$, the left child of an element at index $$i$$ is at $$2i + 1$$, and the right child is at $$2i + 2$$

Heapify is the process of converting a binary tree into a heap data structure.

## Sorting

In a max heap, swap the root element of the heap (which is the largest element in current heap) with the last element of the heap.

Remove/Ignore the last element of the heap (which is now in the correct position) and heapify the remaining elements of the heap.

repeat the following steps until the heap contains only one element & we get sorted array.
