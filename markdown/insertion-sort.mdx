Insertion sort is a stable and in-place sorting algorithm where the basic idea is to take an item from the input list and insert it into the proper position in a sorted output list (which initially starts empty).

> For example if sorting cards split the cards into two groups the sorted cards and the unsorted cards. Then, pick a card from the unsorted group and put it in the right place in the sorted group.

1. We start with second element of the array as first element in the array is assumed to be sorted.
2. Compare second element with the first element and swap them if needed.
3. Move to the third element and compare it with the first two elements and put at its correct position
4. We do this till all elements are checked.

It is efficient for small lists and nearly sorted lists but inefficient for large lists.

> The number of inversions is directly proportional to number of swaps. For example, no swapping happens for a sorted array and it takes $$\text{O}(n)$$ time only.

Insertion sort can be used when the list is small or nearly sorted (having few inversions)

- It is used in Hybrid Sorting algorithms along with other efficient algorithms like Quick Sort and Merge Sort.
  - When the subarray size becomes small, we switch to insertion sort in these recursive algorithms.
- Insertion sort can be used as a subroutine in Bucket Sort
