The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. Each iteration of selection sort consists of scanning across the array, finding the minimum element that hasn't already been placed yet, then swapping it to the appropriate position.

1. First we find the smallest element and swap it with the first element, this way we get the smallest element at its correct position.
2. Then we find the smallest among remaining elements (or second smallest) and swap it with the second element.
3. We keep doing this until we get all elements moved to correct position.

```java {7-13}
public int[] sortArray(int[] nums) {
    // we will need nums.length passess
    for (int i = 0 ; i < nums.length; i++ ) {

        int smallestElementIndex = i;

        // find the smallest element
        for (int j = i+1; j < nums.length; j++ ) {
            if (nums[j] < nums[smallestElementIndex]) {
                smallestElementIndex = j;
            }
        }
        if(smallestElementIndex != i) swap(nums,i,smallestElementIndex);

    }

   return nums;
}
```

Heapsort greatly improves the basic algorithm by using an implicit heap data structure to speed up finding and removing the lowest element.

## Comparison with other quadratic sorting algorithm

- Selection sort almost always outperforms bubble sort but perform worse than insertion sort.
- Insertion sort's advantage is that it only scans as many elements as it needs in order to place the $${k+1}_{st}$$ element, while selection sort must scan all remaining elements to find the $${k+1}_{st}$$ element.
- Selection sort is preferable to insertion sort in terms of number of writes ( $$n-1$$ versus $$\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$ )with each swap being two writes), this is roughly twice the theoretical minimum achieved by cycle sort, which performs at most n writes. This can be important if writes are significantly more expensive than reads.
